# sdk_python
python api node SDK

How to use this SDK:
First you need to check that have next libraries:
- hashlib
- base58check
- ed25519
- struct
- thriftpy2
installed on your PC  where you will execute your code.

Next copy and updste repository:

1. git clone https://github.com/CREDITSCOM/sdk_python.git
2. cd  sdk_python (I think this is the name of cloned directory on your pc)
3. git submodule update --recursive


You can see how it works running test_t.py where you'll find necessary command blocks, those you can use in your code.
